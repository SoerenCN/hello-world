Hello-world! 

Real life is about more than just programming and coding! 

Coding is an art form that is applicable to the "real" World if you learn to merge the two. Right now coding seems far away from the real world to me, but I hope through GitHub, projects and continous learning from get-togethers', that I will learn much more how to connect the two. I also hope to join others who share a passion to make the world a better place through coding. 

My mission: Try merge sense of fun, life style and dreams with profession (coding)!
